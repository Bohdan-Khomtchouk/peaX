`peaX` is a data package that provides human transcription factor and histone modification ChIP-seq peaks data from ENCODE and ROADMAP Epigenomics.

Currently supported ChIP-seq peak lists in the `peaX` package include: 

1) Proximal, distal, and total peak sets for H3K4me1
2) Proximal, distal, and total peak sets for H3K4me3
3) Proximal, distal, and total peak sets for H3K9ac
4) Proximal, distal, and total peak sets for H3K27ac
5) Proximal, distal, and total peak sets for transcription factors

For more information on a specific organism, please refer to the package documentation, e.g.:

```{r}
library(peaX)
?H3K4me3_total
```
