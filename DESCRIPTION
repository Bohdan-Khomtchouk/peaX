Description: Provides human transcription factor and histone modification ChIP-seq peaks data from
    ENCODE and ROADMAP Epigenomics.  Files originally downloaded in bigBed format, converted to BED, 
    and then tidied up to include only peak coordinates (chromosome number, peak start position, peak end
    position) in preparation for large-scale functional annotation.
